# Project 1: Student Grade Prediction
### Purpose: Creat a tool that predict students' grade to help 
### Data: 

![Grade Prediction](https://github.com/YerinKwak/Yerin_Education/blob/main/Images/Grade%20Prediction.png)

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
 * Analyzed data sets using graphs and heatmap to find overall pattern, outliers, and correlations
2. Feature Engineering
 * Skewed data: Log formation
 * Highly correlated features: Integration
3. Models
 * Linear Regression
 * XGBoost
 * Ridge, Lasso: to reduce the influence of highly correlated features with regularization
4. Results
 * Compared RMSE of each model (Best model: 1.59)
 * Visualized the actual score and the predicted one to compare both
